    A type of database transaction that has four important properties:
</p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <b>Atomicity</b>: The operations that constitute the transaction will either
            all succeed or all fail. There is no in-between state.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Consistency</b>: The transaction cannot bring the database to an invalid
            state. After the transaction is committed or rolled back, the rules for each
            record will still apply, and all future transactions will see the effect of
            the transaction. Also named <b>Strong Consistency</b>.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Isolation</b>: The execution of multiple transactions concurrently will
            have the same effect as if they had been executed sequentially.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Durability</b>: Any committed transaction is written to non-volatile
            storage. It will not be undone by a crash, power loss, or network partition.
        </li>
    </ul></div></li><li><h4 class="GyBtJFVn5Wz_IeSLo-24A">ACL</h4><div class="_3EIucFs8X9vDDm7jFP0WE4"><p>
    Short for <b>Access-Control List</b>. This term is often used to refer to a
    permissioning model: which users in a system can perform which operations. For
    instance, APIs often come with ACLs defining which users can delete, edit, or
    view certain entities.
</p></div></li><li><h4 class="GyBtJFVn5Wz_IeSLo-24A">AES</h4><div class="_3EIucFs8X9vDDm7jFP0WE4"><p>
    Stands for <b>Advanced Encryption Standard</b>. AES is a widely used
    encryption standard that has three symmetric-key algorithms (AES-128, AES-192,
    and AES-256).
</p>
    <p>
        Of note, AES is considered to be the "gold standard" in encryption and is even
        used by the U.S. National Security Agency to encrypt top secret information.
    </p></div></li><li><h4 class="GyBtJFVn5Wz_IeSLo-24A">Alerting</h4><div class="_3EIucFs8X9vDDm7jFP0WE4"><p>
    The process through which system administrators get notified when critical
    system issues occur. Alerting can be set up by defining specific thresholds
    on monitoring charts, past which alerts are sent to a communication channel
    like Slack.
</p></div></li><li><h4 class="GyBtJFVn5Wz_IeSLo-24A">Apache Kafka  </h4><div class="_3EIucFs8X9vDDm7jFP0WE4"><p>
    A distributed messaging system created by LinkedIn. Very useful
    when using the <b>streaming</b> paradigm as opposed to <b>polling</b>.
</p></div></li><li><h4 class="GyBtJFVn5Wz_IeSLo-24A">Asymmetric Encryption</h4><div class="_3EIucFs8X9vDDm7jFP0WE4"><p>
    Also known as public-key encryption, asymmetric encryption relies on two
    keys—a public key and a private key—to encrypt and decrypt data. The keys are
    generated using cryptographic algorithms and are mathematically connected such
    that data encrypted with the public key can only be decrypted with the private
    key.
</p>
    <p>
        While the private key must be kept secure to maintain the fidelity of this
        encryption paradigm, the public key can be openly shared.
    </p>
    <p>
        Asymmetric-key algorithms tend to be slower than their symmetric counterparts.
    </p></div></li><li><h4 class="GyBtJFVn5Wz_IeSLo-24A">Availability</h4><div class="_3EIucFs8X9vDDm7jFP0WE4"><p>
    The odds of a particular server or service being up and running at any point
    in time, usually measured in percentages. A server that has 99% availability
    will be operational 99% of the time (this would be described as having two
    <b>nines</b> of availability).
</p></div></li><li><h4 class="GyBtJFVn5Wz_IeSLo-24A">Availability Zone</h4><div class="_3EIucFs8X9vDDm7jFP0WE4"><p>
    Sometimes referred to as an <b>AZ</b>, an availability zone designates a group
    of machines that share one or more central system components (e.g., power
    source, network connectivity, machine-cooling system). Availability zones are
    typically located far away from each other such that no natural disaster can
    realistically bring down two of them at once. This ensures that if you have
    redundant storage, for instance, with data stored in two availability zones,
    losing one <b>AZ</b> still leaves you with an operational system that abides
    by any <b>SLA</b> that it might have.
</p></div></li><li><h4 class="GyBtJFVn5Wz_IeSLo-24A">Blob Storage</h4><div class="_3EIucFs8X9vDDm7jFP0WE4"><p>
    Widely used kind of storage, in small and large scale systems. They don’t
    really count as databases per se, partially because they only allow the user
    to store and retrieve data based on the name of the blob. This is sort of like
    a key-value store but usually blob stores have different guarantees. They
    might be slower than KV stores but values can be megabytes large (or sometimes
    gigabytes large). Usually people use this to store things like
    <b>large binaries, database snapshots, or images</b> and other static assets
    that a website might have.
</p>
    <p>
        Blob storage is rather complicated to have on premise, and only giant
        companies like Google and Amazon have infrastructure that supports it. So
        usually in the context of System Design interviews you can assume that you
        will be able to use <b>GCS</b> or <b>S3</b>. These are blob storage services
        hosted by Google and Amazon respectively, that cost money depending on how
        much storage you use and how often you store and retrieve blobs from that
        storage.
    </p></div></li><li><h4 class="GyBtJFVn5Wz_IeSLo-24A">Cache</h4><div class="_3EIucFs8X9vDDm7jFP0WE4"><p>
    A piece of hardware or software that stores data, typically meant to retrieve
    that data faster than otherwise.
</p>
    <p>
        Caches are often used to store responses to network requests as well as
        results of computationally-long operations.
    </p>
    <p>
        Note that data in a cache can become <b>stale</b> if the main source of truth
        for that data (i.e., the main database behind the cache) gets updated and the
        cache doesn't.
    </p></div></li><li><h4 class="GyBtJFVn5Wz_IeSLo-24A">Cache Eviction Policy</h4><div class="_3EIucFs8X9vDDm7jFP0WE4"><p>
    The policy by which values get evicted or removed from a cache. Popular cache
    eviction policies include <b>LRU</b> (least-recently used), <b>FIFO</b> (first
    in first out), and <b>LFU</b> (least-frequently used).
</p></div></li><li><h4 class="GyBtJFVn5Wz_IeSLo-24A">Cache Hit</h4><div class="_3EIucFs8X9vDDm7jFP0WE4"><p>When requested data is found in a cache.</p></div></li><li><h4 class="GyBtJFVn5Wz_IeSLo-24A">Cache Miss</h4><div class="_3EIucFs8X9vDDm7jFP0WE4"><p>
    When requested data could have been found in a cache but isn't. This is
    typically used to refer to a negative consequence of a system failure or of a
    poor design choice. For example:
</p>
    <p>
        <i>
            If a server goes down, our load balancer will have to forward requests to a
            new server, which will result in cache misses.
        </i>
    </p></div></li><li><h4 class="GyBtJFVn5Wz_IeSLo-24A">CAP Theorem</h4><div class="_3EIucFs8X9vDDm7jFP0WE4"><p>
    Stands for <b>Consistency</b>, <b>Availability</b>,
    <b>Partition tolerance</b>. In a nutshell, this theorem states that any
    distributed system can only achieve 2 of these 3 properties. Furthermore,
    since almost all useful systems do have network-partition tolerance, it's
    generally boiled down to: <i>Consistency vs. Availability; pick one</i>.
</p>
    <p>
        One thing to keep in mind is that some levels of consistency are still
        achievable with high availability, but <i>strong</i> consistency is much
        harder.
    </p></div></li><li><h4 class="GyBtJFVn5Wz_IeSLo-24A">Certificate Authority</h4><div class="_3EIucFs8X9vDDm7jFP0WE4"><p>
    A trusted entity that signs digital certificates—namely, SSL certificates that
    are relied on in <b>HTTPS</b> connections.
</p></div></li><li><h4 class="GyBtJFVn5Wz_IeSLo-24A">Client</h4><div class="_3EIucFs8X9vDDm7jFP0WE4"><p>
    A machine or process that requests data or service from a server.
</p>
    <p>
        Note that a single machine or piece of software can be both a client and a
        server at the same time. For instance, a single machine could act as a server
        for end users and as a client for a database.
    </p></div></li><li><h4 class="GyBtJFVn5Wz_IeSLo-24A">Client—Server Model</h4><div class="_3EIucFs8X9vDDm7jFP0WE4"><p>
    The paradigm by which modern systems are designed, which consists of clients
    requesting data or service from servers and servers providing data or service
    to clients.
</p></div></li><li><h4 class="GyBtJFVn5Wz_IeSLo-24A">Cloud Pub/Sub  </h4><div class="_3EIucFs8X9vDDm7jFP0WE4"><p>
    A highly-scalable Pub/Sub messaging service created by Google. Guarantees
    <b>at-least-once delivery</b> of messages and supports "rewinding" in order to
    reprocess messages.
</p></div></li><li><h4 class="GyBtJFVn5Wz_IeSLo-24A">Configuration</h4><div class="_3EIucFs8X9vDDm7jFP0WE4"><p>
    A set of parameters or constants that are critical to a system. Configuration
    is typically written in <b>JSON</b> or <b>YAML</b> and can be either <b>static</b>, meaning
    that it's hard-coded in and shipped with your system's application code (like
    frontend code, for instance), or <b>dynamic</b>, meaning that it lives outside
    of your system's application code.
</p></div></li><li><h4 class="GyBtJFVn5Wz_IeSLo-24A">Consensus Algorithm</h4><div class="_3EIucFs8X9vDDm7jFP0WE4"><p>
    A type of complex algorithms used to have multiple entities agree on a single
    data value, like who the "leader" is amongst a group of machines. Two popular
    consensus algorithms are <b>Paxos</b> and <b>Raft</b>.
</p></div></li><li><h4 class="GyBtJFVn5Wz_IeSLo-24A">Consistent Hashing</h4><div class="_3EIucFs8X9vDDm7jFP0WE4"><p>
    A type of hashing that minimizes the number of keys that need to be remapped
    when a hash table gets resized. It's often used by load balancers to
    distribute traffic to servers; it minimizes the number of requests that get
    forwarded to different servers when new servers are added or when existing
    servers are brought down.
</p></div></li><li><h4 class="GyBtJFVn5Wz_IeSLo-24A">Content Delivery Network</h4><div class="_3EIucFs8X9vDDm7jFP0WE4"><p>
    A <b>CDN</b> is a third-party service that acts like a cache for your servers.
    Sometimes, web applications can be slow for users in a particular region if
    your servers are located only in another region. A CDN has servers all around
    the world, meaning that the latency to a CDN's servers will almost always be
    far better than the latency to your servers. A CDN's servers are often referred
    to as <b>PoPs</b> (Points of Presence). Two of the most popular CDNs are
    <b>Cloudflare</b> and <b>Google Cloud CDN</b>.
</p></div></li><li><h4 class="GyBtJFVn5Wz_IeSLo-24A">CRUD Operations</h4><div class="_3EIucFs8X9vDDm7jFP0WE4"><p>
    Stands for <b>Create</b>, <b>Read</b>, <b>Update</b>,
    <b>Delete</b> Operations. These four operations often serve as the bedrock of a
    functioning system and therefore find themselves at the core of many APIs.
    The term <b>CRUD</b> is very likely to come up during an API-design interview.
</p></div></li><li><h4 class="GyBtJFVn5Wz_IeSLo-24A">Cypher</h4><div class="_3EIucFs8X9vDDm7jFP0WE4"><p>
    A <b>graph query language</b> that was originally developed for the Neo4j
    graph database, but that has since been standardized to be used with other
    graph databases in an effort to make it the "SQL for graphs."
</p>
    <p>
        Cypher queries are often much simpler than their SQL counterparts. Example
        Cypher query to find data in <b>Neo4j</b>, a popular graph database:
    </p>
    <pre>MATCH (some_node:SomeLabel)-[:SOME_RELATIONSHIP]-&gt;(some_other_node:SomeLabel {some_property:'value'})
</pre></div></li><li><h4 class="GyBtJFVn5Wz_IeSLo-24A">Database Index</h4><div class="_3EIucFs8X9vDDm7jFP0WE4"><p>
    A special auxiliary data structure that allows your database to perform
    certain queries much faster. Indexes can typically only exist to reference
    structured data, like data stored in relational databases. In practice, you
    create an index on one or multiple columns in your database to greatly speed
    up <b>read</b> queries that you run very often, with the downside of slightly
    longer <b>writes</b> to your database, since writes have to also take place in
    the relevant index.
</p></div></li><li><h4 class="GyBtJFVn5Wz_IeSLo-24A">Database Lock</h4><div class="_3EIucFs8X9vDDm7jFP0WE4"><p>
    In a relational database that provides ACID transactions, updating rows inside
    a table will cause a <b>lock</b> to be held on that table or on the rows you
    are updating. If a second transaction tries to update the same rows, it will
    block before the update until the first transaction releases that lock. This
    is one of the core mechanisms behind the <b>Atomicity</b> of ACID
    transactions.
</p></div></li><li><h4 class="GyBtJFVn5Wz_IeSLo-24A">Databases</h4><div class="_3EIucFs8X9vDDm7jFP0WE4"><p>
    Databases are programs that either use disk or memory to do 2 core things:
    <b>record</b> data and <b>query</b> data. In general, they are themselves
    servers that are long lived and interact with the rest of your application
    through network calls, with protocols on top of TCP or even HTTP.
</p>
    <p>
        Some databases only keep records in memory, and the users of such databases
        are aware of the fact that those records may be lost forever if the machine or
        process dies.
    </p>
    <p>
        For the most part though, databases need persistence of those records, and
        thus cannot use memory. This means that you have to write your data to disk.
        Anything written to disk will remain through power loss or network partitions,
        so that’s what is used to keep permanent records.
    </p>
    <p>
        Since machines die often in a large scale system, special disk partitions or
        volumes are used by the database processes, and those volumes can get
        recovered even if the machine were to go down permanently.
    </p></div></li><li><h4 class="GyBtJFVn5Wz_IeSLo-24A">DDoS Attack</h4><div class="_3EIucFs8X9vDDm7jFP0WE4"><p>
    Short for "distributed denial-of-service attack", a DDoS attack is a DoS
    attack in which the traffic flooding the target system comes from many
    different sources (like thousands of machines), making it much harder to
    defend against.
</p></div></li><li><h4 class="GyBtJFVn5Wz_IeSLo-24A">Disk</h4><div class="_3EIucFs8X9vDDm7jFP0WE4"><p>
    Usually refers to either <b>HDD (hard-disk drive)</b> or
    <b>SSD (solid-state drive)</b>. Data written to disk will persist through
    power failures and general machine crashes. Disk is also referred to as
    <b>non-volatile storage</b>.
</p>
    <p>
        SSD is far faster than HDD (see latencies of accessing data from SSD and HDD)
        but also far more expensive from a financial point of view. Because of that,
        HDD will typically be used for data that's rarely accessed or updated, but
        that's stored for a long time, and SSD will be used for data that's frequently
        accessed and updated.
    </p></div></li><li><h4 class="GyBtJFVn5Wz_IeSLo-24A">Distributed File System</h4><div class="_3EIucFs8X9vDDm7jFP0WE4"><p>
    A Distributed File System is an abstraction over a (usually large) cluster of
    machines that allows them to act like one large file system. The two most
    popular implementations of a DFS are the <b>Google File System</b> (GFS) and
    the <b>Hadoop Distributed File System</b> (HDFS).
</p>
    <p>
        Typically, DFSs take care of the classic <b>availability</b> and
        <b>replication</b> guarantees that can be tricky to obtain in a
        distributed-system setting. The overarching idea is that files are split into
        chunks of a certain size (4MB or 64MB, for instance), and those chunks are
        sharded across a large cluster of machines. A central control plane is in
        charge of deciding where each chunk resides, routing reads to the right nodes,
        and handling communication between machines.
    </p>
    <p>
        Different DFS implementations have slightly different APIs and semantics, but
        they achieve the same common goal: extremely large-scale persistent storage.
    </p></div></li><li><h4 class="GyBtJFVn5Wz_IeSLo-24A">DNS</h4><div class="_3EIucFs8X9vDDm7jFP0WE4"><p>
    Short for Domain Name System, it describes the entities and protocols involved in the
    translation from domain names to IP Addresses. Typically, machines make a DNS query to
    a well known entity which is responsible for returning the IP address (or multiple ones)
    of the requested domain name in the response.
</p></div></li><li><h4 class="GyBtJFVn5Wz_IeSLo-24A">DoS Attack</h4><div class="_3EIucFs8X9vDDm7jFP0WE4"><p>
    Short for "denial-of-service attack", a DoS attack is an attack in which a
    malicious user tries to bring down or damage a system in order to render it
    unavailable to users. Much of the time, it consists of flooding it with
    traffic. Some DoS attacks are easily preventable with rate limiting, while
    others can be far trickier to defend against.
</p></div></li><li><h4 class="GyBtJFVn5Wz_IeSLo-24A">Etcd  </h4><div class="_3EIucFs8X9vDDm7jFP0WE4"><p>
    Etcd is a strongly consistent and highly available key-value store that's
    often used to implement leader election in a system.
</p></div></li><li><h4 class="GyBtJFVn5Wz_IeSLo-24A">Eventual Consistency</h4><div class="_3EIucFs8X9vDDm7jFP0WE4"><p>
    A consistency model which is unlike <b>Strong Consistency</b>. In this model,
    reads might return a view of the system that is stale. An eventually
    consistent datastore will give guarantees that the state of the database will
    eventually reflect writes within a time period (could be 10 seconds, or
    minutes).
</p></div></li><li><h4 class="GyBtJFVn5Wz_IeSLo-24A">File System</h4><div class="_3EIucFs8X9vDDm7jFP0WE4"><p>
    An abstraction over a storage medium that defines how to manage data. While
    there exist many different types of file systems, most follow a hierarchical
    structure that consists of directories and files, like the
    <b>Unix file system</b>'s structure.
</p></div></li><li><h4 class="GyBtJFVn5Wz_IeSLo-24A">Forward Proxy</h4><div class="_3EIucFs8X9vDDm7jFP0WE4"><p>
    A server that sits between a client and servers and acts on behalf of the
    client, typically used to mask the client's identity (IP address). Note that
    forward proxies are often referred to as just proxies.
</p></div></li><li><h4 class="GyBtJFVn5Wz_IeSLo-24A">Google Cloud Storage  </h4><div class="_3EIucFs8X9vDDm7jFP0WE4"><p>GCS is a blob storage service provided by Google.</p></div></li><li><h4 class="GyBtJFVn5Wz_IeSLo-24A">Gossip Protocol</h4><div class="_3EIucFs8X9vDDm7jFP0WE4"><p>
    When a set of machines talk to each other in a uncoordinated manner in a
    cluster to spread information through a system without requiring a central
    source of data.
</p></div></li><li><h4 class="GyBtJFVn5Wz_IeSLo-24A">Graph Database</h4><div class="_3EIucFs8X9vDDm7jFP0WE4"><p>
    A type of database that stores data following the graph data model. Data
    entries in a graph database can have explicitly defined relationships, much
    like nodes in a graph can have edges.
</p>
    <p>
        Graph databases take advantage of their underlying graph structure to perform
        complex queries on deeply connected data very fast.
    </p>
    <p>
        Graph databases are thus often preferred to relational databases when dealing
        with systems where data points naturally form a graph and have multiple levels
        of relationships—for example, social networks.
    </p></div></li><li><h4 class="GyBtJFVn5Wz_IeSLo-24A">Hadoop  </h4><div class="_3EIucFs8X9vDDm7jFP0WE4"><p>
    A popular, open-source framework that supports MapReduce jobs and many
    other kinds of data-processing pipelines. Its central component is <b>HDFS</b>
    (Hadoop Distributed File System), on top of which other technologies have
    been developed.
</p></div></li><li><h4 class="GyBtJFVn5Wz_IeSLo-24A">Hashing Function</h4><div class="_3EIucFs8X9vDDm7jFP0WE4"><p>
    A function that takes in a specific data type (such as a string
    or an identifier) and outputs a number. Different inputs <i>may</i>
    have the same output, but a good hashing function attempts to
    minimize those <b>hashing collisions</b> (which is equivalent to
    maximizing <b>uniformity</b>).
</p></div></li><li><h4 class="GyBtJFVn5Wz_IeSLo-24A">High Availability</h4><div class="_3EIucFs8X9vDDm7jFP0WE4"><p>
    Used to describe systems that have particularly high levels of availability,
    typically 5 nines or more; sometimes abbreviated "HA".
</p></div></li><li><h4 class="GyBtJFVn5Wz_IeSLo-24A">Horizontal Scaling</h4><div class="_3EIucFs8X9vDDm7jFP0WE4"><p>
    Scaling a system horizontally means adding more machines to perform the same
    task, resulting in increased throughput for the system. Typically, horizontal
    scaling increases a system's throughput roughly linearly with the number of
    machines performing a given task.
</p></div></li><li><h4 class="GyBtJFVn5Wz_IeSLo-24A">Hot Spot</h4><div class="_3EIucFs8X9vDDm7jFP0WE4"><p>
    When distributing a workload across a set of servers, that workload might be
    spread unevenly. This can happen if your <b>sharding key</b> or your <b>hashing function</b>
    are suboptimal, or if your workload is naturally skewed: some servers will
    receive a lot more traffic than others, thus creating a "hot spot".
</p></div></li><li><h4 class="GyBtJFVn5Wz_IeSLo-24A">HTTP</h4><div class="_3EIucFs8X9vDDm7jFP0WE4"><p>
    The <b>H</b>yper<b>T</b>ext <b>T</b>ransfer <b>P</b>rotocol is a very common network protocol implemented on top
    of TCP. Clients make HTTP requests, and servers respond with a response.
</p>
    <p>
        Requests typically have the following schema: <br>
    </p><pre>host: string (example: algoexpert.io)
port: integer (example: 80 or 443)
method: string (example: GET, PUT, POST, DELETE, OPTIONS or PATCH)
headers: <key, value=""> pair list (example: "Content-Type" =&gt; "application/json")
body: opaque sequence of bytes</key,></pre>
    <p></p>
    <p>
        Responses typically have the following schema: <br>
    </p><pre>status code: integer (example: 200, 401)
headers: <key, value=""> pair list (example: "Content-Length" =&gt; 1238)
body: opaque sequence of bytes</key,></pre>
    <p></p></div></li><li><h4 class="GyBtJFVn5Wz_IeSLo-24A">HTTPS</h4><div class="_3EIucFs8X9vDDm7jFP0WE4"><p>
    The <b>H</b>yper<b>T</b>ext <b>T</b>ransfer <b>P</b>rotocol <b>S</b>ecure is
    an extension of <b>HTTP</b> that's used for secure communication online. It
    requires servers to have trusted certificates (usually
    <b>SSL certificates</b>) and uses the Transport Layer Security (<b>TLS</b>), a
    security protocol built on top of <b>TCP</b>, to encrypt data communicated
    between a client and a server.
</p></div></li><li><h4 class="GyBtJFVn5Wz_IeSLo-24A">Idempotent Operation</h4><div class="_3EIucFs8X9vDDm7jFP0WE4"><p>
    An operation that has the same ultimate outcome regardless of how many times
    it's performed. If an operation can be performed multiple times without
    changing its overall effect, it's idempotent. Operations performed through a
    <b>Pub/Sub</b> messaging system typically have to be idempotent, since Pub/Sub
    systems tend to allow the same messages to be consumed multiple times.
</p>
    <p>
        For example, increasing an integer value in a database is <i>not</i> an
        idempotent operation, since repeating this operation will not have the same
        effect as if it had been performed only once. Conversely, setting a value to
        "COMPLETE" <i>is</i> an idempotent operation, since repeating this operation
        will always yield the same result: the value will be "COMPLETE".

    An address given to each machine connected to the public internet. IPv4
    addresses consist of four numbers separated by dots: <b>a.b.c.d</b> where all
    four numbers are between 0 and 255. Special values include:
</p>
    <ul>
        <li>

    Sometimes more broadly referred to as just a (network) <b>packet</b>, an IP
    packet is effectively the smallest unit used to describe data being sent over
    <b>IP</b>, aside from bytes. An IP packet consists of:
</p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            an <b>IP header</b>, which contains the source and destination
            <b>IP addresses</b> as well as other information related to the network

    The time it takes for a certain operation to complete in a system. Most often
    this measure is a time duration, like milliseconds or seconds. You should know
    these orders of magnitude:
</p>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Reading 1 MB from RAM</b>: 250 μs (0.25 ms)</li>
        <li><b>Reading 1 MB from SSD</b>: 1,000 μs (1 ms)</li>
        <li><b>Transfer 1 MB over Network</b>: 10,000 μs (10 ms)</li>
        <li><b>Reading 1MB from HDD</b>: 20,000 μs (20 ms)</li>

    </ul></div></li><li><h4 class="GyBtJFVn5Wz_IeSLo-24A">Leader Election</h4><div class="_3EIucFs8X9vDDm7jFP0WE4"><p>
    The process by which nodes in a cluster (for instance, servers in a set of
    servers) elect a so-called "leader" amongst them, responsible for the primary
    operations of the service that these nodes support. When correctly
    implemented, leader election guarantees that all nodes in the cluster know
    which one is the leader at any given time and can elect a new leader if the
    leader dies for whatever reason.
</p></div></li><li><h4 class="GyBtJFVn5Wz_IeSLo-24A">Load Balancer</h4><div class="_3EIucFs8X9vDDm7jFP0WE4"><p>
    A type of <b>reverse proxy</b> that distributes traffic across servers. Load
    balancers can be found in many parts of a system, from the DNS layer all the
    way to the database layer.
</p></div></li><li><h4 class="GyBtJFVn5Wz_IeSLo-24A">Logging</h4><div class="_3EIucFs8X9vDDm7jFP0WE4"><p>
    The act of collecting and storing logs--useful information about events in
    your system. Typically your programs will output log messages to its STDOUT
    or STDERR pipes, which will automatically get aggregated into a <b>centralized
    logging solution</b>.
</p></div></li><li><h4 class="GyBtJFVn5Wz_IeSLo-24A">Man-In-The-Middle Attack</h4><div class="_3EIucFs8X9vDDm7jFP0WE4"><p>
    An attack in which the attacker intercepts a line of communication that is
    thought to be private by its two communicating parties.
</p>
    <p>
        If a malicious actor intercepted and mutated an IP packet on its way from a
        client to a server, that would be a man-in-the-middle attack.
    </p>
    <p>
        MITM attacks are the primary threat that encryption and <b>HTTPS</b> aim to
        defend against.
    </p></div></li><li><h4 class="GyBtJFVn5Wz_IeSLo-24A">MapReduce</h4><div class="_3EIucFs8X9vDDm7jFP0WE4"><p>
    A popular framework for processing very large datasets in a distributed
    setting efficiently, quickly, and in a fault-tolerant manner. A MapReduce job
    is comprised of 3 main steps:
</p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            the <b>Map</b> step, which runs a <b>map function</b> on the various chunks
            of the dataset and transforms these chunks into intermediate
            <b>key-value pairs</b>.
        </li>
        <li>
            the <b>Shuffle</b> step, which reorganizes the intermediate
            <b>key-value pairs</b> such that pairs of the same key are routed
            to the same machine in the final step.
        </li>
        <li>
            the <b>Reduce</b> step, which runs a <b>reduce function</b> on the newly
            shuffled <b>key-value pairs</b> and transforms them into more meaningful
            data.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        The canonical example of a MapReduce use case is counting the number of
        occurrences of words in a large text file.
    </p>
    <p>
        When dealing with a MapReduce library, engineers and/or systems administrators
        only need to worry about the map and reduce functions, as well as their inputs
        and outputs. All other concerns, including the parallelization of tasks and
        the fault-tolerance of the MapReduce job, are abstracted away and taken care
        of by the MapReduce implementation.
    </p></div></li><li><h4 class="GyBtJFVn5Wz_IeSLo-24A">Memory</h4><div class="_3EIucFs8X9vDDm7jFP0WE4"><p>

    The process of having visibility into a system's key metrics, monitoring is
    typically implemented by collecting important events in a system and
    aggregating them in human-readable charts.

    When a system is primarily made up of a single large web application that is
    compiled and rolled out as a unit. Typically a counterpart of
    <b>microservices</b>. Companies sometimes try to split up this monolith into
    microservices once it reaches a very large size in an attempt to increase
    <b>developer productivity</b>.

    Pronounced "engine X"—not "N jinx", Nginx is a very popular webserver that's
    often used as a <b>reverse proxy</b> and <b>load balancer</b>.
</p></div></li><li><h4 class="GyBtJFVn5Wz_IeSLo-24A">Nines</h4><div class="_3EIucFs8X9vDDm7jFP0WE4"><p>
    Typically refers to percentages of uptime. For example, 5 nines of
    availability means an uptime of 99.999% of the time. Below are the downtimes
    expected per year depending on those 9s:
</p>
    <pre>- 99% (two 9s): 87.7 hours
- 99.9% (three 9s): 8.8 hours
- 99.99%: 52.6 minutes
- 99.999%: 5.3 minutes
</pre></div></li><li><h4 class="GyBtJFVn5Wz_IeSLo-24A">Node/Instance/Host</h4><div class="_3EIucFs8X9vDDm7jFP0WE4"><p>
    These three terms refer to the same thing most of the time: a virtual or
    physical machine on which the developer runs processes. Sometimes the word
    <b>server</b> also refers to this same concept.
</p></div></li><li><h4 class="GyBtJFVn5Wz_IeSLo-24A">Non-Relational Database</h4><div class="_3EIucFs8X9vDDm7jFP0WE4"><p>
    In contrast with relational database (SQL databases), a type of database that
    is free of imposed, tabular-like structure. Non-relational databases are often
    referred to as NoSQL databases.
</p></div></li><li><h4 class="GyBtJFVn5Wz_IeSLo-24A">NoSQL Database</h4><div class="_3EIucFs8X9vDDm7jFP0WE4"><p>Any database that is not SQL-compatible is called NoSQL.</p></div></li><li><h4 class="GyBtJFVn5Wz_IeSLo-24A">Pagination</h4><div class="_3EIucFs8X9vDDm7jFP0WE4"><p>
    When a network request potentially warrants a really large response, the
    relevant API might be designed to return only a single <b>page</b>
    of that response (i.e., a limited portion of the response), accompanied by an
    identifier or token for the client to request the next page if desired.
</p>
    <p>
        Pagination is often used when designing <b>List</b> endpoints. For instance,
        an endpoint to list videos on the YouTube Trending page could return a huge
        list of videos. This wouldn't perform very well on mobile devices due to the
        lower network speeds and simply wouldn't be optimal, since most users will
        only ever scroll through the first ten or twenty videos. So, the API could be
        designed to respond with only the first few videos of that list; in this case,
        we would say that the API response is <b>paginated</b>.

    Two consensus algorithms that, when implemented correctly, allow for the
    synchronization of certain operations, even in a distributed setting.
</p></div></li><li><h4 class="GyBtJFVn5Wz_IeSLo-24A">Peer-To-Peer Network</h4><div class="_3EIucFs8X9vDDm7jFP0WE4"><p>
    A collection of machines referred to as peers that divide a workload between
    themselves to presumably complete the workload faster than would otherwise be
    possible. Peer-to-peer networks are often used in file-distribution systems.
</p></div></li><li><h4 class="GyBtJFVn5Wz_IeSLo-24A">Percentiles</h4><div class="_3EIucFs8X9vDDm7jFP0WE4"><p>
    Most often used when describing a <b>latency distribution</b>. If
    your <b>X</b>th percentile is 100 milliseconds, it means that
    <b>X</b>% of the requests have latencies of 100ms or less. Sometimes,
    SLAs describe their guarantees using these percentiles.
</p></div></li><li><h4 class="GyBtJFVn5Wz_IeSLo-24A">Persistent Storage</h4><div class="_3EIucFs8X9vDDm7jFP0WE4"><p>
    Usually refers to disk, but in general it is any form of storage that persists
    if the process in charge of managing it dies.
</p></div></li><li><h4 class="GyBtJFVn5Wz_IeSLo-24A">Polling</h4><div class="_3EIucFs8X9vDDm7jFP0WE4"><p>
    The act of fetching a resource or piece of data regularly at an interval to
    make sure your data is not too stale.
</p></div></li><li><h4 class="GyBtJFVn5Wz_IeSLo-24A">Port</h4><div class="_3EIucFs8X9vDDm7jFP0WE4"><p>
    In order for multiple programs to listen for new network connections on the
    same machine without colliding, they pick a <b>port</b> to listen on. A port
    is an integer between 0 and 65,535 (2<sup>16</sup> ports total).
</p>
    <p>
        Typically, ports 0-1023 are reserved for <i>system ports</i> (also called
        <i>well-known</i> ports) and shouldn't be used by user-level processes.
        Certain ports have pre-defined uses, and although you usually won't be
        required to have them memorized, they can sometimes come in handy. Below are
        some examples:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>22: Secure Shell</li>
        <li>53: DNS lookup</li>

    Often shortened as <b>Pub/Sub</b>, the Publish/Subscribe pattern is a popular
    messaging model that consists of <b>publishers</b> and <b>subscribers</b>.
    Publishers publish messages to special <b>topics</b> (sometimes called
    <b>channels</b>) without caring about or even knowing who will read those
    messages, and subscribers subscribe to topics and read messages coming through
    those topics.
</p>
    <p>
        Pub/Sub systems often come with very powerful guarantees like
        <b>at-least-once delivery</b>, <b>persistent storage</b>,
        <b>ordering</b> of messages, and <b>replayability</b> of messages.
    </p></div></li><li><h4 class="GyBtJFVn5Wz_IeSLo-24A">Quadtree</h4><div class="_3EIucFs8X9vDDm7jFP0WE4"><p>
    A tree data structure most commonly used to index two-dimensional spatial
    data. Each node in a quadtree has either zero children nodes (and is therefore
    a leaf node) or exactly four children nodes.
</p>
    <p>
        Typically, quadtree nodes contain some form of spatial data—for example,
        locations on a map—with a maximum capacity of some specified number <b>n</b>.
        So long as nodes aren't at capacity, they remain leaf nodes; once they reach
        capacity, they're given four children nodes, and their data entries are split
        across the four children nodes.
    </p>
    <p>
        A quadtree lends itself well to storing spatial data because it can be
        represented as a grid filled with rectangles that are recursively subdivided
        into four sub-rectangles, where each quadtree node is represented by a
        rectangle and each rectangle represents a spatial region. Assuming we're
        storing locations in the world, we can imagine a quadtree with a maximum
        node-capacity <b>n</b> as follows:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            The root node, which represents the entire world, is the outermost
            rectangle.
        </li>
        <li>
            If the entire world has more than <b>n</b> locations, the outermost
            rectangle is divided into four quadrants, each representing a region of the
            world.
        </li>
        <li>
            So long as a region has more than <b>n</b> locations, its corresponding
            rectangle is subdivided into four quadrants (the corresponding node in the
            quadtree is given four children nodes).
        </li>
        <li>
            Regions that have fewer than <b>n</b> locations are undivided rectangles
            (leaf nodes).
        </li>
        <li>
            The parts of the grid that have many subdivided rectangles represent densely
            populated areas (like cities), while the parts of the grid that have few
            subdivided rectangles represent sparsely populated areas (like rural areas).
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Finding a given location in a perfect quadtree is an extremely fast operation
        that runs in <b>log<sub>4</sub>(x)</b> time (where <b>x</b> is the total
        number of locations), since quadtree nodes have four children nodes.
    </p></div></li><li><h4 class="GyBtJFVn5Wz_IeSLo-24A">Rate Limiting</h4><div class="_3EIucFs8X9vDDm7jFP0WE4"><p>
    The act of limiting the number of requests sent to or from a system. Rate
    limiting is most often used to limit the number of incoming requests in order
    to prevent <b>DoS attacks</b> and can be enforced at the IP-address level, at the
    user-account level, or at the region level, for example. Rate limiting can
    also be implemented in tiers; for instance, a type of network request could be
    limited to 1 per second, 5 per 10 seconds, and 10 per minute.
</p></div></li><li><h4 class="GyBtJFVn5Wz_IeSLo-24A">Redis  </h4><div class="_3EIucFs8X9vDDm7jFP0WE4"><p>
    An in-memory key-value store. Does offer some persistent storage options but is
    typically used as a really fast, best-effort caching solution. Redis is also often
    used to implement <b>rate limiting</b>.
</p></div></li><li><h4 class="GyBtJFVn5Wz_IeSLo-24A">Redundancy</h4><div class="_3EIucFs8X9vDDm7jFP0WE4"><p>
    The process of replicating parts of a system in an effort to make it more

    A type of hashing also coined <b>highest random weight</b> hashing. Allows for
    minimal re-distribution of mappings when a server goes down.
</p></div></li><li><h4 class="GyBtJFVn5Wz_IeSLo-24A">Replication</h4><div class="_3EIucFs8X9vDDm7jFP0WE4"><p>
    The act of duplicating the data from one database server to others. This
    is sometimes used to increase the redundancy of your system and
    tolerate regional failures for instance. Other times you can use
    replication to move data closer to your clients, thus decreasing
    the latency of accessing specific data.
</p></div></li><li><h4 class="GyBtJFVn5Wz_IeSLo-24A">Reverse Proxy</h4><div class="_3EIucFs8X9vDDm7jFP0WE4"><p>
    A server that sits between clients and servers and acts on behalf of the

    A machine or process that provides data or service for a client, usually by
    listening for incoming network calls.
</p>
    <p>
        Note that a single machine or piece of software can be both a client and a
        server at the same time. For instance, a single machine could act as a server
        for end users and as a client for a database.

    How a <b>load balancer</b> chooses servers when distributing traffic amongst
    multiple servers. Commonly used strategies include round-robin, random
    selection, performance-based selection (choosing the server with the best
    performance metrics, like the fastest response time or the least amount of
    traffic), and IP-based routing.
</p></div></li><li><h4 class="GyBtJFVn5Wz_IeSLo-24A">SHA</h4><div class="_3EIucFs8X9vDDm7jFP0WE4"><p>
    Short for "Secure Hash Algorithms", the SHA is a collection of cryptographic

    Sometimes called <b>data partitioning</b>, sharding is the
    act of splitting a database into two or more pieces called
    <b>shards</b> and is typically done to increase the throughput
    of your database. Popular sharding strategies include:
</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Sharding based on a client's region</li>
        <li>Sharding based on the type of data being stored (e.g: user data gets
            stored in one shard, payments data gets stored in another
            shard)</li>
        <li>Sharding based on the hash of a column (only for structured
            data)</li>
    </ul></div></li><li><h4 class="GyBtJFVn5Wz_IeSLo-24A">SLA</h4><div class="_3EIucFs8X9vDDm7jFP0WE4"><p>
    Short for "service-level agreement", an SLA is a collection of guarantees
    given to a customer by a service provider. SLAs typically make guarantees on a
    system's availability, amongst other things. SLAs are made up of one or
    multiple SLOs.
</p></div></li><li><h4 class="GyBtJFVn5Wz_IeSLo-24A">SLO</h4><div class="_3EIucFs8X9vDDm7jFP0WE4"><p>
    Short for "service-level objective", an SLO is a guarantee given to a customer
    by a service provider. SLOs typically make guarantees on a system's
    availability, amongst other things. SLOs constitute an SLA.
</p></div></li><li><h4 class="GyBtJFVn5Wz_IeSLo-24A">Socket</h4><div class="_3EIucFs8X9vDDm7jFP0WE4"><p>
    A kind of file that acts like a stream. Processes can read and write to
    sockets and communicate in this manner. Most of the time the sockets are
    fronts for TCP connection.
</p></div></li><li><h4 class="GyBtJFVn5Wz_IeSLo-24A">Spatial Database</h4><div class="_3EIucFs8X9vDDm7jFP0WE4"><p>
    A type of database optimized for storing and querying spatial data like
    locations on a map. Spatial databases rely on spatial indexes like
    <b>quadtrees</b> to quickly perform spatial queries like finding all
    locations in the vicinity of a region.
</p></div></li><li><h4 class="GyBtJFVn5Wz_IeSLo-24A">SQL</h4><div class="_3EIucFs8X9vDDm7jFP0WE4"><p>
    Structured Query Language. Relational databases can be used using a derivative
    of SQL such as PostgreSQL in the case of Postgres.
</p></div></li><li><h4 class="GyBtJFVn5Wz_IeSLo-24A">SQL Database</h4><div class="_3EIucFs8X9vDDm7jFP0WE4"><p>
    Any database that supports SQL. This term is often used synonymously with
    "Relational Database", though in practice, not <i>every</i> relational
    database supports SQL.
</p></div></li><li><h4 class="GyBtJFVn5Wz_IeSLo-24A">SSL Certificate</h4><div class="_3EIucFs8X9vDDm7jFP0WE4"><p>
    A digital certificate granted to a server by a <b>certificate authority</b>.
    Contains the server's public key, to be used as part of the
    <b>TLS handshake</b> process in an <b>HTTPS</b> connection.
</p>
    <p>
        An SSL certificate effectively confirms that a public key belongs to the
        server claiming it belongs to them. SSL certificates are a crucial defense
        against <b>man-in-the-middle attacks</b>.
    </p></div></li><li><h4 class="GyBtJFVn5Wz_IeSLo-24A">Stateful</h4><div class="_3EIucFs8X9vDDm7jFP0WE4"><p>
    A server or process is called "stateful" when it derives its
    functionality from storing and retrieving things from disk.
    Databases are primary case studies for stateful servers. Because of this
    persistence requirement, it's much more difficult to run and manage
    stateful servers compared to <b>Stateless</b> servers because they
    can't be stopped and restarted on any physical machine.
</p></div></li><li><h4 class="GyBtJFVn5Wz_IeSLo-24A">Stateless</h4><div class="_3EIucFs8X9vDDm7jFP0WE4"><p>
    A server is usually called "stateless" if it does not <i>require</i>
    state to be persisted to disk in order to run successfully. Although
    many server process typically hold some state in memory including
    caching layers for instance, this typically means that we can
    run the server process the same way on any machine, and move
    it around whenever we want. This contrasts with <b>Stateful</b>
    processes.
</p></div></li><li><h4 class="GyBtJFVn5Wz_IeSLo-24A">Streaming</h4><div class="_3EIucFs8X9vDDm7jFP0WE4"><p>
    In networking, it usually refers to the act of continuously getting a feed of
    information from a server by keeping an open connection between the two
    machines or processes.
</p></div></li><li><h4 class="GyBtJFVn5Wz_IeSLo-24A">Strong Consistency</h4><div class="_3EIucFs8X9vDDm7jFP0WE4"><p>
    Strong Consistency usually refers to the consistency of ACID transactions, as opposed to <b>Eventual Consistency</b>.
</p></div></li><li><h4 class="GyBtJFVn5Wz_IeSLo-24A">Symmetric Encryption</h4><div class="_3EIucFs8X9vDDm7jFP0WE4"><p>
    A type of encryption that relies on only a single key to both encrypt and
    decrypt data. The key must be known to all parties involved in communication
    and must therefore typically be shared between the parties at one point or
    another.
</p>
    <p>
        Symmetric-key algorithms tend to be faster than their asymmetric counterparts.
    </p>
    <p>
        The most widely used symmetric-key algorithms are part of the Advanced
        Encryption Standard (<b>AES</b>).
    </p></div></li><li><h4 class="GyBtJFVn5Wz_IeSLo-24A">TCP</h4><div class="_3EIucFs8X9vDDm7jFP0WE4"><p>
    Network protocol built on top of the Internet Protocol (IP). Allows for
    ordered, reliable data delivery between machines over the public internet by
    creating a <b>connection</b>.
</p>
    <p>
        TCP is usually implemented in the kernel, which exposes <b>sockets</b> to
        applications that they can use to stream data through an open connection.
    </p></div></li><li><h4 class="GyBtJFVn5Wz_IeSLo-24A">Throughput</h4><div class="_3EIucFs8X9vDDm7jFP0WE4"><p>
    The number of operations that a system can handle properly per time unit. For
    instance the throughput of a server can often be measured in requests per
    second (RPS or QPS).
</p></div></li><li><h4 class="GyBtJFVn5Wz_IeSLo-24A">Time Series Database</h4><div class="_3EIucFs8X9vDDm7jFP0WE4"><p>
    A <b>TSDB</b> is a special kind of database optimized for storing and
    analyzing time-indexed data: data points that specifically occur at a given
    moment in time. Examples of TSDBs are InfluxDB, Prometheus, and Graphite.
</p></div></li><li><h4 class="GyBtJFVn5Wz_IeSLo-24A">TLS</h4><div class="_3EIucFs8X9vDDm7jFP0WE4"><p>
    The <b>T</b>ransport <b>L</b>ayer <b>S</b>ecurity is a security protocol over
    which <b>HTTP</b> runs in order to achieve secure communication online. "HTTP
    over TLS" is also known as <b>HTTPS</b>.
</p></div></li><li><h4 class="GyBtJFVn5Wz_IeSLo-24A">TLS Handshake</h4><div class="_3EIucFs8X9vDDm7jFP0WE4"><p>
    The process through which a client and a server communicating over
    <b>HTTPS</b> exchange encryption-related information and establish a secure
    communication. The typical steps in a TLS handshake are roughly as follows:
</p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            The client sends a <b>client hello</b>—a string of random bytes—to the
            server.
        </li>
        <li>
            The server responds with a <b>server hello</b>—another string of random
            bytes—as well as its <b>SSL certificate</b>, which contains its
            <b>public key</b>.
        </li>
        <li>
            The client verifies that the certificate was issued by a
            <b>certificate authority</b> and sends a <b>premaster secret</b>—yet another
            string of random bytes, this time encrypted with the server's public key—to
            the server.
        </li>
        <li>
            The client and the server use the client hello, the server hello, and the
            premaster secret to then generate the same <b>symmetric-encryption</b> session keys,
            to be used to encrypt and decrypt all data communicated during the remainder
            of the connection.
        </li>
    </ul></div></li><li><h4 class="GyBtJFVn5Wz_IeSLo-24A">Vertical Scaling</h4><div class="_3EIucFs8X9vDDm7jFP0WE4"><p>
    Scaling a system vertically means increasing the resources (CPU / Memory)
    available to a certain task on a single machine, so that your throughput may
    increase.
</p></div></li><li><h4 class="GyBtJFVn5Wz_IeSLo-24A">Virtual Machine</h4><div class="_3EIucFs8X9vDDm7jFP0WE4"><p>
    A <b>VM</b> is a form of computer inside of a computer. It
    is a program that you run on a machine that completely
    emulates a new kernel and operating system. Very useful when
    isolating programs from one another while having them
    share the same physical machine.
</p></div></li><li><h4 class="GyBtJFVn5Wz_IeSLo-24A">Worker Pool Pattern</h4><div class="_3EIucFs8X9vDDm7jFP0WE4"><p>
    Similar to the <b>Task Queue Pattern</b>. In this design, a pool of workers,
    usually themselves servers, take tasks off of a single shared queue and
    process those tasks independently. In order to ensure that every task gets
    done at least once despite potential partitions between queue and workers, the
    workers <i>must</i> confirm the status of the task after it is done (usually
    <b>success</b> or <b>failure</b>).
</p></div></li><li><h4 class="GyBtJFVn5Wz_IeSLo-24A">YAML</h4><div class="_3EIucFs8X9vDDm7jFP0WE4"><p>A file format mostly used in configuration. Example:</p>
    <pre>version: 1.0
name: AlgoExpert Configuration
</pre></div></li><li><h4 class="GyBtJFVn5Wz_IeSLo-24A">ZooKeeper  </h4><div class="_3EIucFs8X9vDDm7jFP0WE4"><p>
    ZooKeeper is a strongly consistent, highly available key-value store. It's
    often used to store important configuration or to perform leader election.
